# Verified Answers — WordPress/WooCommerce Integration

A WordPress plugin that renders FAQ content server-side for SEO and LLM crawlability. Includes a Docker-based local development environment with WooCommerce, sample products, and sample FAQ data.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

On first run, the `wpcli` service installs WordPress, WooCommerce, the Storefront theme, and seeds sample products and pages. Once you see `Setup complete!` in the logs, visit:

- **Store**: http://localhost:8080
- **Admin**: http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/ (admin / admin)

### Sample Content

**Products** (FAQs render in a WooCommerce product tab):
- http://localhost:8080/product/blue-snowboard/
- http://localhost:8080/product/red-snowboard/
- http://localhost:8080/product/green-jacket/

**Pages** (FAQs auto-injected after content or via shortcode):
- http://localhost:8080/shipping-returns/
- http://localhost:8080/about-our-store/

### Reset Everything

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```

The `-v` flag removes the database and WordPress volumes, so the seed script runs again from scratch.

## Plugin: `verified-answers-faq`

The plugin lives in `plugin/verified-answers-faq/` and is volume-mounted into the WordPress container. Edits to plugin files are reflected immediately (no rebuild needed).

### How It Works

1. **Each page/product gets a FAQ Set ID** via a meta box in the WordPress editor sidebar (stored as `_va_faq_set_id` post meta).
2. **The data provider** loads FAQs for that set ID — currently from a local JSON file (`data/sample-faqs.json`), designed to switch to the Verified Answers REST API later.
3. **FAQs render server-side** as HTML in the initial response (no client-side JS fetching), so content is visible to `curl`, Googlebot, and LLM crawlers.

### SSR Rendering

All FAQ content is rendered in PHP before the response is sent:

- **Product pages**: FAQs appear as a WooCommerce product tab via the `woocommerce_product_tabs` filter
- **Pages/posts**: FAQs are appended after `the_content` automatically when a FAQ set ID is assigned
- **Shortcode**: `[verified_answers_faq set="general-store-faqs" heading="Store FAQ"]` for manual placement anywhere

### Structured Data

The plugin injects [FAQPage JSON-LD](https://schema.org/FAQPage) into `<head>` on any page with FAQs. This enables rich results in Google and makes the content machine-readable for AI assistants.

Verify with: `curl -s http://localhost:8080/product/blue-snowboard/ | grep 'application/ld+json'`

    └── va-faq.css                      # FAQ accordion styles
```

### Connecting to the Verified Answers API

When the platform's publish REST API is ready, the switch requires no code changes:

1. Go to **Settings > Verified Answers FAQ** in WP Admin
2. Enter the **API URL** and **API Key**
3. The data provider automatically fetches from the API instead of the local JSON file, with transient caching (configurable TTL)

The local JSON file serves as a fallback if the API is unreachable.

## Architecture

```
docker-compose.yml
├── db          — MySQL 8.0 (persistent volume)
├── wordpress   — WordPress + PHP 8.2 + Apache (port 8080)
│                 └── plugin volume-mounted from ./plugin/
└── wpcli       — WP-CLI (runs seed/setup.sh on first boot)
```

The `seed/setup.sh` script handles all first-run configuration: WordPress install, WooCommerce setup, theme activation, product/page creation, and FAQ set assignment via post meta.
