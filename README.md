# Verified Answers — WordPress/WooCommerce Integration

A WordPress plugin that renders FAQ content server-side for SEO and LLM crawlability. Includes a Docker-based local development environment with WooCommerce, sample products, and sample FAQ data.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

On first run, the `wpcli` service installs WordPress, WooCommerce, the Storefront theme, and seeds sample products and pages. Once you see `Setup complete!` in the logs, visit:

- **Store**: http://localhost:8080
- **Admin**: http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/ (admin / admin)

### Sample Content

**Products** (FAQs render in a WooCommerce product tab):
- http://localhost:8080/product/blue-snowboard/
- http://localhost:8080/product/red-snowboard/
- http://localhost:8080/product/green-jacket/

**Pages** (FAQs auto-injected after content or via shortcode):
- http://localhost:8080/shipping-returns/
- http://localhost:8080/about-our-store/

### Reset Everything

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```

The `-v` flag removes the database and WordPress volumes, so the seed script runs again from scratch.

## Plugin: `verified-answers-faq`

The plugin lives in `plugin/verified-answers-faq/` and is volume-mounted into the WordPress container. Edits to plugin files are reflected immediately (no rebuild needed).

### How It Works

1. **Each page/product gets a FAQ Set ID** via a meta box in the WordPress editor sidebar (stored as `_va_faq_set_id` post meta).
2. **The data provider** loads FAQs for that set ID — currently from a local JSON file (`data/sample-faqs.json`), designed to switch to the Verified Answers REST API later.
3. **FAQs render server-side** as HTML in the initial response (no client-side JS fetching), so content is visible to `curl`, Googlebot, and LLM crawlers.

### SSR Rendering

All FAQ content is rendered in PHP before the response is sent:

- **Product pages**: FAQs appear as a WooCommerce product tab via the `woocommerce_product_tabs` filter
- **Pages/posts**: FAQs are appended after `the_content` automatically when a FAQ set ID is assigned
- **Shortcode**: `[verified_answers_faq set="general-store-faqs" heading="Store FAQ"]` for manual placement anywhere

### Structured Data

The plugin injects [FAQPage JSON-LD](https://schema.org/FAQPage) into `<head>` on any page with FAQs. This enables rich results in Google and makes the content machine-readable for AI assistants.

Verify with: `curl -s http://localhost:8080/product/blue-snowboard/ | grep 'application/ld+json'`

```

### Connecting to the Verified Answers API

When the platform's publish REST API is ready, the switch requires no code changes:

1. Go to **Settings > Verified Answers FAQ** in WP Admin
2. Enter the **API URL** and **API Key**
3. The data provider automatically fetches from the API instead of the local JSON file, with transient caching (configurable TTL)

The local JSON file serves as a fallback if the API is unreachable.

## Releasing & Client Distribution

Every PR merged to `main` automatically triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Increments the patch version (e.g. `v1.0.0` → `v1.0.1`)
2. Updates the version in the plugin PHP file
3. Zips `plugin/verified-answers-faq/` into `verified-answers-faq.zip`
4. Creates a tagged GitHub Release with the zip attached

### Installing a Release (Client Instructions)

Since the repo is private, clients need a **fine-grained GitHub personal access token** to download releases.

**Create a token:**

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Set **Resource owner** to the repo owner (`benatwork`)
4. Under **Repository access**, select only `verified-answers-wordpress`
5. Under **Permissions → Repository permissions**, set **Contents** to `Read-only`
6. Generate and copy the token

**Download a release zip:**

```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN and the version tag as needed
curl -L \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" \
  "$(curl -s \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
    'https://api.github.com/repos/benatwork/verified-answers-wordpress/releases/latest' \
    | grep '"browser_download_url"' | cut -d'"' -f4)" \
  -o verified-answers-faq.zip
```

Or navigate directly to the [Releases page](https://github.com/benatwork/verified-answers-wordpress/releases) while logged in to GitHub with an account that has repo access and download the zip manually.

**Install in WordPress:**

1. In WP Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
2. Choose `verified-answers-faq.zip` and click **Install Now**
3. Activate the plugin

To update an existing installation, upload the new zip — WordPress will prompt you to replace the current version.

## Architecture

```
docker-compose.yml
├── db          — MySQL 8.0 (persistent volume)
├── wordpress   — WordPress + PHP 8.2 + Apache (port 8080)
│                 └── plugin volume-mounted from ./plugin/
└── wpcli       — WP-CLI (runs seed/setup.sh on first boot)
```

The `seed/setup.sh` script handles all first-run configuration: WordPress install, WooCommerce setup, theme activation, product/page creation, and FAQ set assignment via post meta.
